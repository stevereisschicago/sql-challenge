# sql-challenge
This is the homework for Unit 9 - SQL - the files are  in the HOMEWORK branch

The pdf file 9 "SQL Homework - Steve Reiss" includes the ERD chart, the code, and images of the code with the data outputs for all of the data analysis questions

The ERD chart is saved in the pdf, but also as both "ERD CHART - SR" and as "QuickDBD-Free Diagram.sql"

The table schemata are also in the "table_schemata" text file

The queries are also in the "queries" text file

Thank you for your help!
